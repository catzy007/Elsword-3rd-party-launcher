Q : Why on earth you make this program?
A : Well the first time i came with this is to avoid official launcher for deleting modified kom files

Q : why would you modify kom files?
A : good questions, i play void elsword and it has no japanese voice so i would love to change that

Q : are this launcher really works?
A : umm actually there are two answer for that

Q : explain it!
A : the first answer is this launcher actually works nicely. and the second answer is no. this launcher dosen't help me modifying kom files so it doesn't meet my initial expectation.

Q : then why you said this launcher works?
A : yeah it's works because you doesn't need official launcher. just put launcherx.exe with same folder as official launcher, execute and boom you doesn't need to update and press any stupid button.

Q : are this program safe?
A : umm if you ask about virus or something just close this page. if you ask about ban or something similar, of course not! this is 3rd party. what would you expect!

Q : so how to run this?
A : put launcherx.exe in same directory as official launcher, then open launcherx.exe

Q : thank you
A : you're welcome
